# snakeGameGo

To start the project, run main and then you move the snake with the arrow keys. Red apples make you grow and rotten apples make you lose two pieces of food. 
Watch out for hitting youself, the borders or eating too much rotten food. You start off with no food so if you eat a rotten apple before you eat two pieces you die!
Have fun!
